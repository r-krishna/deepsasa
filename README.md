# deepsasa
Pytorch model for predicting solvent accessible surface area of Fvs.

Inspired by RaptorX-Contact/Property, AlphaFold1 and trRosetta, I wanted to build a model that predicted a distribution of SASAs for Fabs. Downstream, this can be useful in predicting solubility/aggregation potential of mAbs.
